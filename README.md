# henon-invariants

A collection of scripts used to plot contours of approximate invaraints for the HÃ©non-Heiles model.
Mathematica notebooks were used for numerical calculations as well as CAS. It is recommended to restart the kernel before running any file to prevent unwanted issues from similar variable names.
